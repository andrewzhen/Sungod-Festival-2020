                      Do NOT mix drugs and alcohol. There is no way to 
                      anticipate how your body will react to the mixture- the 
                      reaction could be very serious or even fatal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Remember: You never know what you are actually taking. 
                      Though distributors may assure you that you are getting a 
                      certain drug, there is a high likelihood that this drug 
                      has been cut with something else, or is a different drug 
                      entirely. This is especially common with pills.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                      <p>If you do choose to engage in drug use:</p>
                      <ul> 
                        <li>
                          Test your pills with an affordable drug testing 
                          kit, like those sold at dancesafe.org. DISCLAIMER: 
                          Drug testing kits do not indicate that a substance is 
                          safe. Drug use is never 100% safe.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                          Make sure to remain hydrated. A good rule of thumb is 
                          to drink about two cups of water (500ml) every hour. 
                          Be careful to not consume water too quickly- this can 
                          cause an electrolyte imbalance that could become 
                          fatal.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                          If you do not feel well, seek help immediately! DO 
                          NOT SLEEP IT OFF. The symptoms of drug overdose can 
                          be the same, more exaggerated, or totally different 
                          than those of excessive alcohol use.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                          You WILL NOT be punished for your drug/alcohol use 
                          retroactively if you seek help from an official. Your 
                          safety is our first priority.
                        </li>

                      <p>For friends of people who are engaging in drug use:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Monitor your friend, and make sure they are 
                            drinking enough water.
                          </li> 
                        <li>
                          If they are displaying extreme or out of character 
                          behavior, get them help. It could be the result of 
                          drugs or excessive alcohol in their system, and their 
                          health may be at risk.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                          By speaking up you could save your friend from 
                          serious harm, and could even save their life.

                       Keep in mind that one drink is a 12 oz beer, 5 oz of 
                       wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor.

                  <h3>Clarifying Consent</h3>
                  <ul> 
                    <li>
                      Consent is a mutual, affirmative, voluntary, and 
                      revocable agreement by each participant to engage in 
                      sexual activity. An informed verbal “yes” must accompany 
                      positive and engaging body language.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                      The initiator of sexual activity is responsible for 
                      receiving consent from their partner. Obtaining consent 
                      is a continuous process, meaning consent to kissing 
                      doesn’t mean consent to everything else. Consent is 
                      voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent must 
                      be given without coercion, force, threats or intimidation 
                      by the initiator.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                      Consent cannot be given when someone is under the 
                      influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, perpetrators 
                      may attempt to use alcohol and/or drugs to facilitate a 
                      sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported 
                      sexual assaults occur while one or both parties are under 
                      the influence of alcohol or drugs. Alcohol or drugs is 
                      never an excuse for choosing to violate another person.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                      There are a number of drugs that may be added to 
                      beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness 
                      or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. 
                      Substances are particularly dangerous when combined with 
                      alcohol, and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim 
                      unclear about what occurred. These drugs can facilitate 
                      criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct 
                      or sexual assault.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                      Sexual assault is any unwanted, non-consensual behavior 
                      from kissing and fondling to rape. Ignorance of the law 
                      or of University policy concerning sexual assault, 
                      sexual misconduct and sexual harassment is never an 
                      excuse for non-consensual sexual behavior.

                  <p>
                    Keeping UC San Diego safe is a community responsibility. 
                    Check out the tips below on how you can help prevent sexual 
                    assault:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Identify common behaviors that often precede an assault. 
                      Recognizable red flags include seeing someone who is 
                      attempting to separate an intoxicated individual from 
                      their friends, or continuing to pour drinks for an 
                      individual who is clearly beyond their limit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Take action as a responsive bystander and remember to use 
                      IDEAS if you see those behaviors happening. You can help 
                      someone who is intoxicated by reconnecting them with 
                      their friends, or calling a CSO to escort that person 
                      home. You can also notify any of the festival volunteers 
                      or law enforcement officials on site if you are concerned 
                      for someone’s safety and well-being.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Supporting Survivors of Sexual Assault</h3>
                  <p>
                    If something happens to a friend, know you can be a 
                    responsive bystander by showing your support:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Listen and believe them. Let them know that you care.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Remember sexual assault is never the fault of the 
                      survivor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Be aware of your response and respect their decisions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Know the resources and seek support for yourself.

                      Non-UCSD-affiliated guests will not be allowed to stay in

                      Festival (April 25 – April 28).  Additionally, residents 
                      are only allowed in their respective residential areas 
                      during specified time periods during the weekend of the

                      responsibly hosting gatherings in their living areas 
                      (regardless of whether alcohol is present). Residents 
                      hosting guests are responsible for ensuring that 
                      attendance does not exceed two guests per resident of 
                      their room/apartment.

                      If your neighbors call or stop by to tell you the party

                      If a guest has had too much to drink, don’t let them 
                      drive home. Call a taxi or arrange for a ride with 
                      another guest who is sober, or invite them to stay over.

                      Acquaint yourself with the San Diego County social host 
                      laws and the consequences of breaking those laws. If 
                      caught breaking these laws, social hosts will be held 
                      accountable and may be: 1) cited/arrested, 2) fined up to 
                      $1000 or more, 3) serve up to 6 months in jail, and 4) be

                      Detox: If your friend is taken to Sun God Festival Detox, 
                      you can call 
                      <a href='tel:858-246-0393'>

                      It takes about 20 minutes for a student to be checked-in, 
                      so there may not be a record of them yet if you call 
                      right after they are picked up. If your friend is 
                      checked in, the volunteer will let you know the estimated 
                      time to call back (approx. 4 hours) and where to pick 
                      them up.

                  <h3>Sleep</h3>
                  <p>
                    Sleep impacts your physical health and your cognitive 
                    functioning. Be sure to get plenty of sleep prior to the 
                    event. Be aware that alcohol and caffeine can have a 
                    negative impact on your sleep.
                  </p> 
                  <h3>Exercise</h3>
                  <p>Regular exercise and physical activity help to improve 
                    your mood and cope with stress and anxiety.
                  </p> 
                  <h3>Eating</h3>
                  <p>Eating right is an important part of stress management, 
                    helps you maintain energy throughout the day, improves 
                    cognitive performance, and keeps your mood steady.
                  </p> 
                  <h3>Time Management</h3>
                  <p>
                    Prepare in advance for the amount of time you’ll need to 
                    study for midterm exams. When you know you have a large 
                    event coming up that will take a lot of time (e.g., 
                    attending a wedding, a birthday party, SUN GOD!), it’s 
                    important to plan effectively. Start weeks in advance and 
                    schedule study time around this large event. This way you 
                    can actually enjoy the event while you are there! It will 
                    also reduce the likelihood of you having to cram and pull 
                    an “all-nighter.”
                  </p> 
                  <h3>Social support</h3>
                  <p>
                    Relationships are one of the most important factors of 
                    well-being. Developing, deepening, and maintaining close, 
                    supportive relationships help us to flourish. While at 
                    UCSD, it’s important to not just focus on academics, but to 
                    find a sense of belonging and community; to be part of a 
                    group in which you feel you are a valued member. Close 
                    relationships help to reduce loneliness and provide support 
                    during stressful times.
                  </p> 
                  <h3>Find your passion</h3>
                  <p>
                    Find at least one interest or hobby that you can pursue and 
                    look forward to once or twice a week. “Engagement” in 
                    activities in which you get completely absorbed and feel 
                    perfectly challenged, neither bored nor overwhelmed, can be 
                    extremely rewarding and help us to flourish.
                  </p>
